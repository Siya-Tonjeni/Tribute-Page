            <span>Rihanna is born</span>
            <span><br>born Robyn Rihanna Fenty, on February 20, 1988, in Barbados, Rihanna signed with Def Jam records at age 16 and in 2005 released her first album Music of the Sun, which sold more than two million copies worldwide.</span>

          <li value="2005">
            <span>Rihanna's debut single "Pon de Replay"</span>
            <span><br>The studio version of "Pon de Replay" was released in May 2005. The dance-pop, reggae-infused track hit No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 when Rihanna was just 17 years old.</span>
          </li>
          <li value="2007">
            <span>The game-changing track "Umbrella"</span>
            <span><br>As Billboard's Joe Lynch writes, when "Umbrella (feat. Jay-Z)" dropped, "Rihanna already had two albums and four top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits under her belt. But for a burgeoning pop icon, she was short just one thing: An instantly iconic pop smash that would prove she was in it for the long game."</span>

            <span>First Grammy Award</span>
            <span><br>Rihanna earned four nominations for the 50th annual Grammy Awards, which was the first time she was recognized by the Recording Academy.</span>

          <li value="2012">
            <span>Her big screen debut with "Battleship"</span>
            <span><br>The summer blockbuster "Battleship" was loosely based on the board game of the same name. It was critically panned, but praise-worthy for Rihanna's big screen debut — for which she was chosen specifically by the film's director, Peter Berg.</span>
          </li>
          <li value="2014">
            <span>Received the CFDA Fashion Icon award</span>
            <span><br>Rihanna walked the 2014 Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) red carpet in a sparkling, sheer gown and little else. But when asked about the daring fashion choice, she laughed it off in a classic Rihanna style: "Do my tits bother you? They're covered in Swarovksi crystals, girl!"</span>

            <span>Most celebrated album yet</span>
            <span><br>Rihanna's eighth studio album "Anti" was surprise-released after three years of anticipation. It was unlike anything the pop star had ever released. It went to No. 1 two weeks after its debut (stalled by a Tidal-exclusive release). It eventually became the first album by a Black female artist to spend 300 weeks on the Billboard 200.</span>
